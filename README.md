Outline of the talk
====================

* Getting Started (15 mins)

    * Differences between React Native and Web
        * Components
        * Style
        * No browsers API such as CSS animations, Canvas, SVG, etc. Or others might have been polyfilled.
    * Component lifecycle
    * Dealing with Props and how to handle them effectively for large-scale application.

* Focusing more on building the app (30 mins)

    * User Input
    * React Navigation (15 mins)
        * What is Navigation and how is it different from Web Navigation? (it is the topic concerning about how you move between screens)
